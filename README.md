Generative AI for CSV/Excel File Interaction via NLP

Project Overview

This project leverages Generative AI to create a system that interacts with CSV/Excel files, allowing users to query the data using natural language. The AI model processes user queries, retrieves relevant data from the files, and provides accurate, context-aware responses. This approach eliminates the need for manual data exploration, making data interaction more intuitive and user-friendly.

Features

Natural Language Querying: Users can ask questions in plain English about the data stored in CSV/Excel files, and the AI will understand and respond accordingly.

Data Retrieval and Manipulation: The AI can perform various operations on the data, such as filtering, sorting, summarizing, and calculating statistics based on user requests.

Seamless Integration with Excel/CSV Files: The system works with standard CSV and Excel files, making it compatible with existing datasets.

Customizable Responses: The model can be trained or fine-tuned to cater to specific data formats or domains, ensuring that the responses are tailored to the user's needs.

How It Works

Data Loading: The system loads CSV or Excel files into a structured format, ready for interaction.

Query Processing: Users input queries in natural language. The generative AI model parses these queries to understand the user's intent.

Data Interaction: Based on the parsed query, the AI interacts with the data, performs the necessary operations, and retrieves the required information.

Response Generation: The AI generates a coherent and contextually appropriate response, providing the user with the requested information.

Usage Example

Suppose you have an Excel file with product sales data. You could ask the AI:

"What is the average price of products in the Electronics category?"

"Show me the top 5 most expensive products."

"How many units of Product_X were sold last month?"

The AI will process these queries and provide you with the answers directly from the data in the file.


Customization

You can customize the AI's behavior by:


Training on specific datasets: Fine-tuning the model to better understand your specific domain or dataset.

Adding custom operations: Extending the AI's capabilities to perform more complex data manipulations.
